# The Pairing Board

![Main Page](./screenshots/01.png "Main Page")

## Purpose
A digital pairing board! This idea was pitched by one of the DBC instructors as a client project. The mission is to give new Dev Bootcamp students a way to connect to experienced DBC students for Saturday mentoring. Currently pairing is accomplished using a white board, it is our goal to replace the physical board with a simple, easy-to-use web application.

## Getting Started

### Mentors
Mentors can make offerings on the Pair Board to let students know their availabilities each Saturday. Offerings are made in half-hour increments between the hours of 900 and 1700.

### Students
Students can view offerings and make appointments, with a couple of restrictions. First, students can not make multiple appointments during the same time slot. Second, students can only book a maximum of one hour with a specific mentor per Saturday. This encourages different pairings, allowing students to strengthen connections with other students.  Usage of Pair Board is restricted to DBC students.

### Messaging
Appointments and cancellations will trigger automated messages to both mentors and students, notifying them of the cancellation.
